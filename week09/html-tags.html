          The World Wide Web, also known as the WWW and the Web, is an information space where documents and other web
          resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via
          the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web
          browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in
          1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in
          August 1991.

          The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions
          of people use to interact on the Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and
          annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[7] In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images,
          video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of
          multimedia content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme, a common
          domain name, or both, make up a website. Website content can largely be provided by the publisher, or
          interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon the users or their actions. Websites
          may be mostly informative, primarily for entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or
          non-governmental organisational purpose.

          Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half of the 1980s.[8] By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System (upon which the Uniform Resource Locator is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.[9] In March 1989 Berners-Lee issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called "Mesh" that referenced ENQUIRE, a database and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term "web" and described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded in readable text: "Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse." Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use the term hypermedia.[10]

          With help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a "Hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" (one word) as a "web" of "hypertext documents" to be viewed by "browsers" using a clientâ€“server architecture.[11] At this point HTML and HTTP had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test. This proposal estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve "the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal" as well as "the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him/her has become available." While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature, with the wiki concept, WebDAV, blogs, Web 2.0 and RSS/Atom.[12]
